- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility compliance
- User onboarding experience

#### Quality Assurance
- Jest testing framework in place
- CI/CD pipeline considerations
- Test coverage for critical user flows
- Performance regression testing

## Multi-Agent Meeting Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Architecture Review**: System-architect to assess current technical architecture
2. **Security Audit**: Security-auditor to review authentication and data handling
3. **Performance Baseline**: Performance-optimizer to establish current metrics
4. **UX Assessment**: UX-researcher to evaluate user experience patterns
5. **Design System Audit**: Design-system-guardian to ensure foundation library usage
6. **Quality Strategy**: Quality-assurance-strategist to plan comprehensive testing

### Secondary Goals
1. **Innovation Opportunities**: Visual-experimental and UX-experimental to identify enhancement areas
2. **Design Refinement**: Visual-refined to assess current aesthetic choices
3. **User Research Gaps**: UX-researcher to identify research needs

## Key Technical Constraints

### Must Follow
- Always use @fourfold/angular-foundation components over custom implementations
- Signal-based patterns (avoid RxJS unless necessary)
- SessionService architecture for data coordination
- Feature-based organization pattern
- Existing Firebase infrastructure

### Development Commands
- `npm start` - Development server
- `npm test` - Jest testing
- `npm run format` - Code formatting
- `npm run build:firebase` - Production build

- Security best practices embedded
- Automated quality assurance
- Design system as competitive advantage

## Agent Coordination Framework

### Meeting Structure
1. **Opening**: Product-owner sets context and objectives
2. **Assessment Phase**: Each agent provides domain-specific analysis
3. **Synthesis Phase**: Cross-functional recommendations
4. **Priority Setting**: Product-owner facilitates priority ranking
5. **Action Planning**: Concrete next steps with ownership
6. **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes defined

### Ongoing Collaboration Model
- Weekly check-ins for active workstreams
- Cross-agent consultation for complex decisions
- Shared documentation in project repository
- Regular retrospectives and process improvement

## Critical Questions for Multi-Agent Team

1. **System-Architect**: How can we improve scalability while maintaining current architecture?
2. **Security-Auditor**: What are our highest security risks and mitigation strategies?
3. **Performance-Optimizer**: Where are our biggest performance bottlenecks?
4. **UX-Researcher**: What user research gaps prevent optimal experience design?
5. **Design-System-Guardian**: How can we maximize @fourfold/angular-foundation usage?
6. **Quality-Assurance-Strategist**: What testing gaps pose the highest risk?
7. **Visual-Experimental**: What innovative UI patterns could differentiate our app?
8. **UX-Experimental**: How can we create more delightful user interactions?
9. **Visual-Refined**: Where can we improve aesthetic sophistication?

This briefing provides the foundation for productive multi-agent collaboration focused on actionable outcomes.
