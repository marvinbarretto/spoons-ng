  - Configure tester feedback collection

## üìã Development Workflow Improvements

### SASS Migration
- [ ] **Address SASS deprecation warnings**
  - Migrate from `@import` to `@use` syntax
  - Update check-in modal stylesheets
  - Update chip component stylesheets
  - Update build pipeline to handle new syntax

### Documentation
- [ ] **Complete documentation**
  - Document Android build and deployment process
  - Create troubleshooting guide for common Android issues
  - Document security practices and key management

## Priority Levels

### üö® Critical (Required for Store Release)
- Environment security
- Release signing
- App metadata

### ‚ö†Ô∏è High (Recommended before Release)
- Network security
- Performance monitoring
- Device testing

### üìã Medium (Post-Release Improvements)
- Bundle optimization
- SASS migration
- Advanced monitoring

## Estimated Timeline

- **Critical items**: 1-2 weeks
- **High priority items**: 2-3 weeks  
- **Medium priority items**: Ongoing/post-release

## Notes

This roadmap represents production readiness requirements. The current setup is sufficient for local testing and development.

For immediate Android testing, the app is ready to use with:
```bash
# Build and sync to Android
npm run cap:build:android

# Open in Android Studio
npm run cap:open:android
```
