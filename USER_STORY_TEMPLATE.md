## **üéØ User Story**

**As a** [Developer/QA Engineer/DevOps Engineer]  
**I want** [testing capability or coverage]  
**So that** [business value or risk mitigation]

**Example:**
> As a **developer**, I want **comprehensive unit tests for the CheckinOrchestrator service**, so that **I can confidently refactor the check-in business logic without introducing regressions**.

---

## **üìñ Background & Context**

### **Current State**
- What exists today? (e.g., "No tests exist for CheckinOrchestrator service")
- What gaps or issues need addressing? (e.g., "Service has 300+ lines of complex business logic")
- Impact on development/production? (e.g., "Risk of breaking check-in flow in production")

### **Technical Context**
- **Architecture Pattern**: (e.g., "Service with dependency injection", "BaseStore collection pattern")
- **Dependencies**: (e.g., "AuthStore, PointsService, BadgeEvaluator, CacheCoherence")  
- **Business Logic Complexity**: (e.g., "High - orchestrates 5+ services with conditional logic")
- **Risk Level**: `Critical` | `High` | `Medium` | `Low`

## **‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria**

### **Given-When-Then Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: [Primary Happy Path]**
```gherkin
Given [initial state/context]
When [action is performed]  
Then [expected outcome]
And [additional verification]
```

#### **Scenario 2: [Error Handling]**
```gherkin
Given [error condition setup]
When [action triggers error]
Then [graceful error handling]
And [proper error propagation]
```

#### **Scenario 3: [Edge Cases]**
```gherkin
Given [edge case conditions]
When [boundary condition is tested]
Then [robust behavior is verified]
```

### **Technical Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Minimum {X}% line coverage for target component
- [ ] **Test Categories**: Unit tests cover all public methods
- [ ] **Mock Quality**: All dependencies properly mocked with realistic behavior
- [ ] **Error Scenarios**: All error conditions tested and handled
- [ ] **Performance**: Tests execute in <{X}ms per test case
- [ ] **Maintainability**: Tests follow established patterns and naming conventions

## **üîß Technical Specifications**

### **Files to Create/Modify**
```
src/app/{domain}/data-access/{service}.spec.ts
src/app/shared/testing/mocks/{domain}-mocks.ts (if needed)
src/app/shared/testing/scenarios/{domain}-scenarios.ts (if needed)
```

### **Testing Patterns Required**
- [ ] **BDD-Style Structure**: `describe > context > it` hierarchy
- [ ] **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test phases
- [ ] **Mock Strategy**: Use centralized mock registry
- [ ] **Test Data**: Leverage realistic scenario builders
- [ ] **Signal Testing**: Proper Angular signals testing patterns

### **Dependencies & Prerequisites**
- [ ] **Mock Infrastructure**: Enhanced mock registry available
- [ ] **Test Utilities**: BDD helpers and custom matchers
- [ ] **Test Data**: Scenario builders for realistic data
- [ ] **CI Integration**: Tests run in automated pipeline

---

## **üèÜ Definition of Done**

### **Code Quality**
- [ ] All tests pass locally and in CI
- [ ] Code coverage meets minimum threshold
- [ ] No linting or formatting errors
- [ ] Performance tests meet execution time requirements

### **Test Quality**
- [ ] Tests are readable and self-documenting
- [ ] Test names clearly describe behavior being tested
- [ ] Mocks are realistic and maintainable
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios covered

### **Documentation**
- [ ] Test documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Mock patterns documented (if new patterns introduced)
- [ ] Complex test scenarios explained with comments

### **Integration**
- [ ] Tests integrated with existing test suite
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing tests

---

## **üìä Success Metrics**

### **Immediate Success Indicators**
- [ ] {X} test cases implemented and passing
- [ ] {Y}% code coverage achieved
- [ ] 0 failing tests in CI pipeline
- [ ] Test execution time <{Z}ms total

### **Long-term Success Indicators**  
- [ ] Reduced bug reports in tested areas
- [ ] Faster development velocity for related features
- [ ] Increased developer confidence in refactoring
- [ ] Improved production stability metrics

---

## **üöÄ Implementation Notes**

### **Recommended Approach**
1. **Start with Happy Path**: Implement main functionality tests first
2. **Add Error Handling**: Test all error conditions and edge cases
3. **Optimize Performance**: Ensure tests run efficiently
4. **Enhance Readability**: Refactor tests for clarity and maintainability

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- ‚ùå Testing implementation details instead of behavior
- ‚ùå Over-mocking (mocking things that don't need mocking)
- ‚ùå Brittle tests that break with minor code changes
- ‚ùå Tests that are too complex or hard to understand

### **Best Practices to Follow**
- ‚úÖ Test behavior, not implementation
- ‚úÖ Use descriptive test names that read like specifications  
- ‚úÖ Keep tests simple, focused, and independent
- ‚úÖ Use realistic test data that mirrors production scenarios
