## 🎯 User Story

As a developer, I want a centralized mock registry with consistent patterns, so that creating and maintaining test mocks is efficient and standardized.

## 📖 Background & Context

Current mock patterns are inconsistent across test files, leading to maintenance overhead and developer confusion.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ✅ Centralized MockRegistry class implemented
- [x] ✅ Auto-dependency resolution for complex services
- [x] ✅ Signal-compatible mock generation
- [x] ✅ Consistent mock patterns across all test files
- [x] ✅ Performance optimization with lazy loading

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/app/shared/testing/core/mock-registry.ts`\n- `src/app/shared/testing/core/auto-mocks.ts`


### Testing Approach
Unit tests for mock registry, integration with existing tests

### Dependencies
