## 🎯 User Story

As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for MissionStore, so that store state management and reactive patterns work reliably across the application.

## 📖 Background & Context

MissionStore (Mission data and progress tracking) has no test coverage despite being critical for application state management.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [x] >80% line coverage for MissionStore
- [x] Reactive signal patterns tested
- [x] Cache coherence behavior verified
- [x] Error recovery mechanisms tested
- [x] Store lifecycle (load/reset/cleanup) tested

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/app/**/mission-store.spec.ts`


### Testing Approach
Signal-based testing with BaseStore patterns

### Dependencies
- Store testing utilities\n- Mock registry

## 🏆 Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Tests follow established patterns and naming conventions
- [x] Code coverage meets minimum threshold
- [x] All tests pass locally and in CI
- [x] Code review completed and approved
- [x] No breaking changes to existing tests

## ✅ RESOLVED
**Status**: Complete  
**Test Coverage**: 14 tests covering initialization, loadOnce caching, CRUD operations, query methods, and error handling  
**Files Created**: `src/app/missions/data-access/mission.store.spec.ts`  
**Implementation Notes**: Used async/await patterns consistent with BadgeStore and PointsStore testing approaches
