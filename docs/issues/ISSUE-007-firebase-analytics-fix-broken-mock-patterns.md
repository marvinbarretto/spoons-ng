## 🎯 User Story

As a developer, I want reliable Firebase Analytics mocks that don't break tests, so that all tests pass consistently and CI pipeline is stable.

## 📖 Background & Context

Currently 7 tests are failing due to broken Firebase Analytics vi.mock() patterns. This blocks all development and creates CI instability.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 7 failing Firebase Analytics tests pass\n- [ ] Analytics mock exports are properly configured\n- [ ] vi.mock() patterns follow established conventions\n- [ ] Tests can run independently without mock pollution

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Files to Create/Modify

- `src/app/shared/testing/mocks/firebase-analytics.mock.ts`\n- `src/**/*.spec.ts (files using analytics mocks)`

### Testing Approach
Fix existing broken mocks, verify with test execution

### Dependencies
- Enhanced mock registry system

## 🏆 Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Tests follow established patterns and naming conventions
- [ ] Code coverage meets minimum threshold
- [ ] All tests pass locally and in CI
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing tests
